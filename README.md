# EPdfG: E-Form PDF generator
EPdfG is a flask-based python web-app that generates pdf documents directly into your "Downloads" folder.

This first iteration is created for official Football Federation Intermediaries but could easily be changed to other templates.

## How to use EPdfG ?
Go to the URI hosting EPdfg (*www.EPdfg.com will be implemented asap* or localhost if hosted locally). If you are not Logged-in, you will be prompted to log in.

Your login credentials identify you (the user) and links to your data. This includes your company name, your company's VAT number, address, etc.

Once logged in, you can access the form of the web-app that will prompt you to input values relative to the player you want to sign a contract with, as well as the details regarding the contract.

Click on the 'Submit' button to generate a pdf file in your Downloads folder.

Click 'Log out' to end your session.
